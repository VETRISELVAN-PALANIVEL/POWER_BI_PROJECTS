Power BI Twitter Data Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard visualizes Twitter data with specific constraints and time-based filters:

    Average Engagement Rate & Total Impressions: Displays data for tweets between 01-01-2020 and 30-06-2020, filtering out tweets with fewer than 100 impressions or 0 likes. Visible only between 3 PM IST to 5 PM IST.

    Scatter Chart (Media Engagement vs. Media Views): Analyzes tweets with more than 10 replies and highlights tweets with an engagement rate above 5%. Visible only between 6 PM IST to 11 PM IST, and includes tweets with word count above 50 and odd-numbered tweet dates.

    Line Chart (Engagement Rate Trend): Shows monthly engagement rate trends, separating tweets with media from those without. Filters out tweets with engagement numbers that are odd, dates that are even, or character count below 20. Visible between 3 PM to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11 AM IST.
